I was at Hakone for the past few days.

Just watched Vice, a movie about the career of Dick Cheney, and learnt a whole lot
about American politics a decade ago which set the stage for the current
political landscape.

Some related articles:

Also rewatched Risk by Laura Poitras. I haven't been keeping an eye on the
security/privacy community for a while. Maybe it's time to start.
